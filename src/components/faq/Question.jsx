        <p className="text-gray-400">We recommend trying a different browser first, or going incognito. Clearing your cache might also do the trick. If not, try restarting your phone or computer, or wait until a little later and try again.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-400 mt-2">After restarting your device and the AI generated images still don't appear, let us know through an email at team@Artio.com or let us a message on Discord and we'll look into it.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">How does the AI model work?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-400">The model learns concepts from images. Each time you enter a prompt, it will create unique images based on its current knowledge and will try to combine the concepts from your prompt in a creative way. You can find more details of an earlier model in our W&B Project Report or the DALL¬∑E mini model card.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-white">Are there biases or limitations in AI generated art?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-400">Yes, seeing as it learns through existing images, it is exposed to societal prejudices and harmful stereotypes so can integrate these into its images. Limitations and bias in AI are still being researched and we're working actively on this subject. You can learn more in the DALL¬∑E mini model card.</p>
